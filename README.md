# Building-Animation
This Pygame animation demonstrates a bouncing ball interacting with a building. The building is drawn with several floors, each labeled with its floor number.
The animation features two code snippets illustrating different approaches to solving a problem involving a bouncing ball.

In the animation, a ball starts at the top of the building and bounces between floors until it reaches a specific target window.
The number of bounces is calculated and displayed, showing how many times the ball has passed the target window. 
The ball's movement and the number of passes are visualized in real-time, with a graphical representation of the building and the bouncing ball.
